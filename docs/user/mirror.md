## Upgrade your node with minimal interruption

1. Modify docker image tag on your compose file
2. Run `docker compose pull`, this will pull the new image.
3. Run `docker compose up -d --remove-orphans`, this will recreate the container
4. Verify that your node restarted well `docker compose logs duniter-rpc`
5. Remove the old image `docker rmi duniter/duniter-v2s:OLD_TAG`
