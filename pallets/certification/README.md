# Duniter certification pallet

Duniter certifications are the *edges* in the Duniter [Web of Trust](../duniter-wot/). They can have different meanings:

- in the case of the main WoT, they mean "I have met this person IRL and trust them" (see Äž1 Licence)
- in the case of the smith sub-WoT, they mean "I trust this person to be able to run Duniter securely" (see smith Licence)

This pallet manages certifications creation, deletion...
