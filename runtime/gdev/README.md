# ÄžDev runtime

Gdev runtime exists for development purposes. It can be changed without consequenses for exploration.
It uses the pallet `duniter-test-parameters` to be able to change parameters values more easily without runtime upgrades.
This is the runtime used by default when running a local blockchain.
